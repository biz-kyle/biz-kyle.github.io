Dean "Iksar" Ayala talked about designing Whispers of the Old Gods on a recent episode of [The Angry Chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3C4njg--7E). He mentioned extensively playtesting C'Thun Rogue decks before release because he was afraid they'd be too powerful.

No one plays C'Thun Rogue (outside of some test decks from [Amaz](http://www.hearthstonetopdecks.com/decks/amazs-reno-cthun-rogue-standard-may-2016/) and other streamers), and those who do certainly don't think it's game-breaking. 

I tried the deck the past week and can find three potential strengths:

* {% include card name="C'Thun" end="'s" %} biggest limitation is costing 10 mana, making him the only thing you can play that turn. Rogue, however, has several 0-cost cards to cheat that rule. C'Thun + {% include card name="Shadowstep" %} \+ C'Thun again is a tremendous amount of burst that is basically unblockable.
* Double {% include card name="Tomb Pillager" %} lets you {% include card name="Innervate" %} out C'Thun or cast another 2 mana worth of cards during the same turn you play him. 
* Rogue has a lot of ways to stealth C'Thun the turn he's played because, again, of mana cheating and {% include card name="Conceal" end="." %} Once that happens, only the most powerful board clears like {% include card name="Equality" %} \+ {% include card name="Consecration" %} will remove the stealthed monstrosity. 

I don't think C'Thun Rogue is especially powerful in the current meta. Without {% include card name="Antique Healbot" end="," %} it struggles too much to stay alive. Things get bleak when it doesn't draw {% include card name="Reno Jackson" end="." %}
