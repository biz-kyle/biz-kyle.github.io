[Blainie](http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/user/28900-blainie/), [documenting](http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/20035-blizzard-removing-alpha-access-as-punishment/) Blizzard's smackdown on its own forums: 

> Both Legion and Overwatch access has been removed for many of those that took part in the "memestorm"!<br><br>The thread in question popped up after there were a number of stability issues with the Alpha servers [for Legion]. Players couldn't log in to test the raids that were scheduled, namely the first Mythic bosses to open for testing.<br><br>It quickly escalated into personal insults and threats, a barrage of memes and "jokes" spanning topics such as 9/11 and terrorism. It seems Blizzard have since revoked the access of these players to the Legion Alpha and Overwatch Beta for an undisclosed period of time. 

It's an alpha- what were they expecting?
