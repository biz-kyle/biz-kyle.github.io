# Website under construction

The underlying code for this website is licensed under GNU. I borrowed freely from others to figure out how to make it. Please, feel free to copy it and use it yourself. My most original creation is the related posts algorithm. While it takes forever to generate matches, it creates high-quality pairs without any work from the user. 

The content on the site, not the site's code, is not licensed freely and may not be reproduced without permission.
