Ben Brode, in a [Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4q10ra/why_are_the_overwatch_devs_so_much_more/d4pyuad) explaining why Whispers of the Old Gods had a conspicuous lack of {% include card name="Mal'Ganis" src="malganis.png" %} replacements:

> Renolock is pretty solid. No demons in WotOG was a flavor decision that I think went over the head of most players, maybe that was a mistake. There are more demons coming, it's core to the kit of Warlock.

Another user explained the WoW lore in play:

> The entire Burning Legion (aka the demons we know and love) was created to combat the old gods by killing all life so that they have nothing to corrupt. Kind of like the Halo rings vs. the Flood.

Looking forward to new demons- Demonlock always seemed cool thematically, just never had enough punch.
