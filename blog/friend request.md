I accepted my last friend request from a recent opponent on Thursday. I had just won with a {% include card name="Knife Juggler" %} + {% include card name="Unleash the Hounds" %} combo as the finisher for my [Midrange Hunter](http://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/legendary-hunter-midrange-brm-deck). He was playing [Aggro Shaman](http://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/shaman-aggro-loe-deck) and was about to win before the Unleash combo (with a well-placed {% include card name="Hunter's Mark" src="huntersmark.png" end=")" %} cleared his board. One {% include card name="Savannah Highmane" %} later he was done. 

After I accepted his friend request, he immediately sent me a message calling me a "faggot" who got lucky for topdecking {% include card name="Explosive Trap" %} and getting lucky juggles. He unfriended me before I could respond. 

The other two times I've accepted friend requests, it's been the same. The first time was after I crushed a bad Druid player with a {% include card name="Muster for Battle" %} + {% include card name="Quartermaster" %} combo in my Control Paladin deck. For that, I was called a "zero-skill nigger." 

The second time was after winning on a lucky {% include card name="Lord Jaraxxus" %} topdeck against a Face Hunter. Again, the other guy friended me to say my win was based purely on luck. 

This is why "friend" requests are rarely that. Whenever I win a close game or a big blowout and immediately see that someone would like to be my friend, I don't accept. I just leave it alone and delete the request a couple hours later after they've forgotten about it. 

At the very least they'll just tell me that I was lucky and therefore did not deserve my win. At worst they'll call me something racist or homophobic.

It baffles me that these people are shocked that a single game of Hearthstone could turn on luck. Chance is an integral part of this game, and it doesn't always go your way. Sometimes your opponent topdecks Jaraxxus when he's at 2 health. That's part of playing a game where you draw cards from a shuffled deck and start with a random hand. 

It's depressing to think that there are so many players in this community that are so toxic and mean-spirited. It says a lot that Blizzard could have put in text and voice chat but didn't. Judging by the amount of bad mannering people do through emotes, I shudder to think what they'd be capable of with full text. Probably more slurs. 

It's sad that accepting friend requests is a bad idea. Maybe some of those people who I barely beat actually enjoyed the game and wanted to say good job! I've felt that way before. A Renoluck smacked down the same Midrange Hunter deck when he [got rich](http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/27228-reno-jackson) one turn before dying. I felt frustrated, but could still appreciate the play. 

So sorry, guy who actually wants to be friends. It's just not worth it to deal with all the angry assholes who feel this powerful need to let me know I'm not any good. I don't want to see that negativity. 

The saddest part of all of this is what I said to a friend who was looking over my shoulder as I won the game that preempted my third and final accepted friend request. 

"Watch this," I said, hovering over the accept request button. "He's gonna be really mad and say something nasty."
