[Standard](http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Standard_format) means new cards and [promised nerfs](http://www.shacknews.com/article/93108/hearthstones-ben-brode-on-new-heroes-druid-nerfs-and-why-standard-is-solution-for-now). Blizzard won't say which cards will change to what, but they've given some hints. They won't even say how many, just that it [will be](http://www.pcgamer.com/ben-brode-on-why-standard-hearthstone-has-to-ditch-the-old-card-expansions/2/) "less than 20 but definitely more than two."

Some of the most powerful cards in the game like {% include card src="pilotedshredder.png" name="Piloted Shredder" %} and {% include card src="drboom.png" name="Dr. Boom" %} are part of Naxxramas and Goblins vs. Gnomes and will rotate out of the format. They probably won't be changed, which leaves the Classic cards that will stay in Standard.

So which ones will be changed? We can make a reasonable guess if you look at Hearthstone from a game designer's point of view. To Blizzard, powerful cards aren't necessarily problematic. The problem is cards that limit potential future expansions (see this excellent [Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3b3hDvRjJA) video).

For example, Piloted Shredder would be nerfed hard because of its ubiquity if it weren't rotating out of Standard. It sees play in most top-tier decks because it's so powerful. Any future 4-mana minions would either have to be more powerful than Shredder (power creep) or trade well with it (limiting future potential playable minions). That's a major restriction on any future 4-drops. 

Blizzard will likely target "auto-includes," cards that we would otherwise play forever. This makes sense from a design perspective, since more variety is better for the game than everyone playing Dr. Boom. 

LiquidHearth [confirmed](http://www.liquidhearth.com/forum/hearthstone/506312-monk-visits-blizzard-changes-coming-to-standard) variety is a focus for Blizzard, saying, "The design team is going to try to avoid cards that can be splashed too easily in every deck." 

My guesses for Blizzard's hitlist: 

* {% include card src="keeperofthegrove.png" name="Keeper of the Grove" %} \- Keeper is a cheap silence and Blizzard [doesn't like that mechanic]({% post_url 2016-04-09-silence-rebalance-counter-hearthstone-standard %}). Easy Silences hard counter most buff decks, again limiting possible cards. 
* {% include card src="ancientoflore.png" name="Ancient of Lore" %}
* {% include card src="tirionfordring.png" name="Tirion Fordring" %} \- Paladin auto-include that will only get stronger as Silence gets weaker. 
* {% include card src="preparation.png" name="Preparation" %}
* {% include card src="masterofdisguise.png" name="Master of Disguise" %} \- Giving any minion permanent stealth has incredible game-breaking potential.
* {% include card src="doomguard.png" name="Doomguard" %} \- Charge is a problematic mechanic, and Doomguard is too strong with the Warlock hero power.
* {% include card src="ironbeakowl.png" name="Ironbeak Owl" %} \- One of the most common auto-includes and another cheap silence. The Owl is already [missing from the deck recipes](http://www.hearthpwn.com/forums/hearthstone-general/general-discussion/121189-deck-recipes-hint-at-ironbeak-owl-nerf). 
* {% include card src="biggamehunter.png" name="Big Game Hunter" %} \- Massive limitation on design space. BGH means we only ever play 7+-attack minions that offer some other benefit (e.x. Boom Bots, 8 damage to a random target, a giant that lets you cheat its mana cost).
* The Giants - Require BGH.
* {% include card src="alexstrasza.png" name="Alexstrasza" %}
* {% include card src="knifejuggler.png" name="Knife Juggler" %} \- The definition of an auto-include for any zoo, aggro or Paladin deck.
* {% include card src="lepergnome.png" name="Leper Gnome" %} \- Another must-have for any aggro deck. 

Interesting side note on choosing individual card nerfs. *PC Gamer* [asked](http://www.pcgamer.com/ben-brode-on-why-standard-hearthstone-has-to-ditch-the-old-card-expansions/2/) Ben Brode about Knife Juggler getting a smackdown:

> I’m really interested in hearing the community’s feedback and what they think the problem cards are and... That’s a good note, I appreciate it. [Laughs]

Brode says little but implies players' feelings toward certain cards will affect what gets changed. Considering the community's [feelings toward Knife Juggler in particular](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/search?q=knife+juggler+nerf&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all), a rebalance seems likely. 

## Class nerfs

Some entire classes will get a much-deserved power reduction. Steve Watts and Ozzie Mejia, for [Shack News](http://www.shacknews.com/article/93108/hearthstones-ben-brode-on-new-heroes-druid-nerfs-and-why-standard-is-solution-for-now): 

> "I will say that in general, when we look at ensuring the Standard format is a dynamically changing environment, I think we have to look at changing the Druid cards," (Brode) said.<br><br>"Because so many of the cards in their decks are from the basic sets, kind of unevenly from every other class in the game. All of its power right now stems from the classic sets, so it’s hard for us to make new cards that are more appealing to Druid players than those basic cards. So we’re definitely looking at those."

Considering how thoroughly Midrange Druid [dominates the meta](https://tempostorm.com/hearthstone/meta-snapshot/its-a-long-road-to-the-top), Blizzard will smack down the Ancients and {% include card src="forceofnature.png" name="Force of Nature" %} + {% include card src="savageroar.png" name="Savage Roar" %}.

Rogue is the other target. This might seem odd given how little Rogue decks have affected the last few months' meta. From [LiquidHearth](http://www.liquidhearth.com/forum/hearthstone/506312-monk-visits-blizzard-changes-coming-to-standard): 

> Basic Rogue cards are seen as slightly too strong. Blizzard is cautious about adding powerful Rogue cards in expansions, since the power level of Rogue Basic cards is already so high. For example, Tinker's Sharpsword Oil and Tomb Pillager are two of the only significant additions in all of the expansions and adventures for the Rogue class. Look for Basic Rogue cards to be nerfed so that more powerful Rogue cards can be added in future expansions.

Curious to see which guesses are right. I'll update when the news comes out.
