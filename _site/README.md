# You found me! 

If you're reading this, you've found the GitHub page for the Maddest Bomber, my Hearthstone blog. I used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to create a static site that I can host and update for free through some really amazing tech. 

Feel free to poke around in the site's guts. I am no programmer, so you might be horrified at what you find. 

## Usage

The underlying code for this website is free to use. I borrowed freely from others to figure out how to make it. Please, feel free to copy it and use it yourself. My most original creation is the related posts algorithm. While it takes forever to generate matches, it creates high-quality pairs without any work from the user. Anyone using Jekyll can take it if they like. 

The content on the site, not the site's code, is not licensed freely and may not be reproduced without permission. Don't be a jerk and just copy my content.
