	<p>When Blizzard <a href="/2016/04/20/nerf-standard-druid-combo-knife-juggler.html">announced the Standard nerfs</a>, I was surprised to see Freeze Mage had somehow escaped Blizzard’s wrath. They targeted cards that were used in too many decks (<span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/oldknifejuggler.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Knife Juggler</span></span>)
 and cards that encouraged uninteractive, unfun burst damage combos (<span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/oldarcanegolem.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Arcane Golem</span></span>).</p>

<p>Under that logic, you’d expect them to target a deck built of uninteractive combos. The whole point of Freeze Mage is to hold your opponent at bay before you burst them down with an uninteractive combo of <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/alexstrasza.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Alexstrasza</span></span>
 and spell damage.</p>

<p>That’s the thing, though. Freeze Mage was nerfed. Blizzard was just subtle about it.</p>

<h2 id="cards-going-away">Cards going away</h2>

<p>The most obvious change to the deck is the loss of <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/madscientist.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Mad Scientist</span></span>.
 That card is always a fantastic draw because it could keep tempo in the early game and pull one of your secrets, all of which are critical to winning.</p>

<p>The ability to pull an <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/iceblock.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Ice Block</span></span>
 from anywhere in your deck was powerful. That secret is a critical part of your win condition, and skipping the three-mana cost to play it is pretty great. <strong>Strike one.</strong></p>

<h2 id="aggro-everywhere">Aggro everywhere</h2>

<p>A deck’s quality is always relative to everything else in the meta. Greedy control decks suffer when aggro is in the driver’s seat, just like aggro took a backseat to control and midrange with the introduction of <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/renojackson.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Reno Jackson</span></span>.</p>

<p>Blizzard knocked Freeze Mage down a peg by taking away Mad Scientist in addition to creating an unfavorable meta for the deck. They left Aggro Shaman with almost all its tools, even giving an incredibly powerful new one with <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/flamewreathedfaceless.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Flamewreathed Faceless</span></span>.</p>

<p>Aggro decks, especially ones that rely on weapon and spell damage, are tough for Freeze Mage to block. Simply put, you can’t <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/flamestrike.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Flamestrike</span></span>
 his <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/doomhammer.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Doomhammer</span></span>.</p>

<p>Besides, the board clears are often too late. Without Mad Scientist to contest the board in the early game and pull an <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/icebarrier.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Ice Barrier</span></span>,
 the early game becomes a matter of drawing as many cards as possible and possibly using single-target removal like <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/forgottentorch.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Forgotten Torch</span></span>.</p>

<p>Waiting until turn 4 or 5 to <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/frostnova.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Frost Nova</span></span>
 + <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/doomsayer.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Doomsayer</span></span>
 is death against a deck as fast as Aggro Shaman. Oh, and Aggro Shaman is all over the ladder. <strong>Strike two.</strong></p>

<h2 id="one-more-bad-matchup">One more bad matchup</h2>

<p>Freeze Mage is even worse off in the current meta because <a href="http://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/legendary-paladin-n-zoth-control-standard-deck">N’Zoth Control</a> exists. A deck built around hard-to-clear deathrattles and copious amounts of healing? Freeze Mage’s worst nightmare.</p>

<p><span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/forbiddenhealing.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Forbidden Healing</span></span>
 is what makes this matchup exponentially more competitive for Paladins. Before, Uther had <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/antiquehealbot.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Antique Healbot</span></span>
 and <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/layonhands.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Lay on Hands</span></span>.
 Those were decent, but they cost a lot of mana relative to the amount of healing.</p>

<p>Now that Paladins are running absurd amounts of healing, I would rate this matchup as much tougher than old Paladin decks like Midrange or Secret. Between <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/nzoththecorruptor.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">N’Zoth, the Corruptor</span></span>
 and Forbidden Healing, Blizzard created another good meta deck that Freeze Mage struggles against. <strong>Strike three.</strong></p>

<h2 id="its-still-decent">It’s still decent</h2>

<p>Freeze Mage in the current meta is an interesting example of how power level actually works in Hearthstone. Despite ostensibly losing few cards, Freeze Mage ended up as a second-tier deck in today’s meta because of the growth of aggro and gaining another bad matchup. An elegant rebalancing.</p>

<p>The best news out of this day is the much-needed death of the Druid combo. Force of Nature + <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/savageroar.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Savage Roar</span></span>
 to deal 14 damage from an empty board (not counting any other minions) was absurdly overpowered.</p>

<p>What interests me most is that Force of Nature is still an alright card that could work in <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/308819-tgt-wings-legendary-token-druid">Token Druid</a> decks.</p>

<h2 id="no-more-auto-includes">No more auto-includes</h2>

<p>Almost everything on this list is <a href="/2016/04/08/hearthstone-standard-nerfs.html">what I guessed would be nerfed</a>. Blizzard used exactly the logic I predicted (which wasn’t much of a prediction given that they directly told us their logic ahead of time).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Strong, widely-played neutral cards can stifle deck-building decisions and homogenize decks. These cards also make it more difficult to create new cards that can compete with them. We’re adjusting these neutral cards so that other cards can become compelling replacements, and open the door for more of a deck’s power to come from its Class identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what I was talking about. Blizzard wants to make a game with lots of different decks and varied gameplay because that’s more interesting than one where everyone plays Knife Juggler, <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/drboom.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Dr. Boom</span></span>
 and <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/pilotedshredder.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Piloted Shredder</span></span>.
 They targeted the cards that were so good you couldn’t not play them. Knife Juggler and Leper Gnome are the poster children of that category.</p>

<h2 id="nerfing-counters">Nerfing counters</h2>

<!-- Imports an image and styles it properly, with caption if

<div class="imgSplash " style="overflow: hidden;">
	<img class="inline " src="/blog/assets/keepernerf.gif" alt="" />

</div>

<p>While Blizzard did not remove Silence from the game, it did make some of the most common silencing minions more costly to play. A pricier Ironbeak Owl will still probably see play, but not as much and it won’t be as powerful.</p>

<p>Keeper of the Grove also took a gigantic nerf. 2/2 is brutal and will relegate it to tech card status instead of Druid mainstay.</p>

<p>I was right about <a href="/2016/04/09/silence-rebalance-counter-hearthstone-standard.html">Blizzard wanting to nerf Silence</a>, but I did not predict the manner in which it would do so. The mechanic will remain in the game, but it’ll cost you more.</p>

<p>That seems to be the trend across the board. Big Game Hunter’s new 5-mana cost is a hard slap to make class-specific removal actually competitive with him. I’ll still play BGH in Wild where Dr. Boom lives eternal, but in Standard? Maybe it’s time to bring back <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/naturalize.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Naturalize</span></span>.</p>

<p>I suspect Blizzard brought the hammer down on Hunter’s Mark not because it was overpowered in the current meta, but because it would be in one where BGH cost 5 mana.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="rogue-gets-a-slight-nerf">Rogue gets a slight nerf</h2>

<p>Blizzard picked an interesting card to nerf with Blade Flurry. I thought it would be <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/preparation.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Preparation</span></span>,
 one of the staples of every deck. But their logic was much stronger:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blade Flurry is a problem because it enables both board clear and heavy burst damage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2 mana to essentially double your weapon damage was always where <a href="http://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/oil-rogue-deck">Oil Rogue</a> was strongest. Having that in the game would mean any substantive weapon upgrades would have to be looked at carefully.</p>

<p>It also means Rogue’s last competitive deck is out of the meta until we see it get good cards again. <a href="http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/376635-top-5-legend-raptor-rogue">Raptor Rogue</a> is decent but it’s not dominated the meta the way Oil used to.</p>

<h2 id="the-ones-that-escaped">The ones that escaped</h2>

<p>Cards that I or others thought would be nerfed, but were not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/alexstrasza.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Alexstrasza</span></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/preparation.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Preparation</span></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/doomguard.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Doomguard</span></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/tirionfordring.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Tirion Fordring</span></span></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m surprised that <a href="http://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/legendary-mage-freeze-loe-deck">Freeze Mage</a> made it out alive when it thrives on uninteractive freezing and damage from hand combos. Maybe Blizz internal stats say it won’t be a problem after losing <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/madscientist.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Mad Scientist</span></span>
 and <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/antiquehealbot.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Antique Healbot</span></span>.</p>

<p>The Doomguard guess was half-right (Blizzard doesn’t like powerful Charge minions) but missed the important part. Doomguard is okay and Arcane Golem is not because the latter is a cheaper neutral minion that can be spliced into any wonky OTK deck.</p>

<p>Tirion, I assume, made it out safe because he is a class card. He’s also not what makes Paladin so good in the current pre-Whispers meta; that honor belongs to <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/mysteriouschallenger.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Mysterious Challenger</span></span>,
 <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/shieldedminibot.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Shielded Minibot</span></span>
 and <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/musterforbattle.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Muster for Battle</span></span>.</p>

<p>Blizzard says the changes will launch with Hearthstone 5.0. Can’t wait to see the new meta!</p>

<h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2016/04/16/hafu-ben-brode-arena-interview-mmr.html">Arena has no hidden matchmaker ranking</a></h1>

	<!-- Date and section info -->

	<!-- Pull header image -->
	

	<p><a href="http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/20151-hearthstones-ben-brode-clarifies-that-there-is-no-mmr-in-arena/">Icy Veins</a>, recapping Ben Brode’s interview with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/itshafu">Hafu</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For months, the Arena community has wondered if there was a hidden Matchmaker Rating (MMR) in Arena that pairs not only players on similar scores, but also players of similar skill. Lead Game Designer, Ben Brode, joined Hafu on her stream to clear up the matter once and for all. He was also asked about some other smaller things.<br /><br />The key point made, was that Matchmaking only looks at win-loss records when pairing players in Arena. The only exception is made for “brand new players”, who are treated as if they have one more loss than they actually have, and will be matched with other new players if possible. The exact numbers are still being tweaked, but this lasts for your first “two or three runs” on a new account.</p>

<p>Amazing how much we don’t know about the inner workings of this game.</p>

	<p><span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/hauntedcreeper.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Haunted Creeper</span></span>
 is cycling out of standard, but sticky minions are not.</p>

<p>A livestream by GameplayRJ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4ec779/new_card_revealed/">revealed</a> <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/twilightsummoner.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Twilight Summoner</span></span>,
 an interesting neutral epic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4-mana, 1/1
Deathrattle: Summon a 5/5 Faceless Destroyer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Twilight Summoner, <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/possessedvillager.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Possessed Villager</span></span>,
 and <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/infestedtauren.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Infested Tauren</span></span>
 show Blizzard sees “sticky” minions (minions that summon other minions as their deathrattle) as a good addition to the game.</p>

<p>While not as strong as previous deathrattle powerhouses Haunted Creeper and <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/pilotedshredder.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Piloted Shredder</span></span>,
 these new minions still survive a board clear. This makes them annoying to control decks but important to the game’s health overall.</p>

<p>A Hearthstone meta with no sticky minions is one where Freeze Mage and other board clear-heavy decks dominate competitive play. Sticky minions empower zoo decks by providing minions and tempo which can’t be immediately wiped away.</p>

<p>Hearthstone has so few ways to interact with your opponents’ spells, especially for aggro decks since <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/loatheb.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Loatheb</span></span>
 is cycling out. Minions that spawn other minions are one of your few ways to fight back against <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/flamestrike.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Flamestrike</span></span>.
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="we-need-aggro">We need aggro</h2>

<p>Sticky minions also provide unique value to aggro decks. Cards like Haunted Creeper and Infested Tauren provide two minions inside one card, an invaluable proposition when your plan is to flood the board with minions and you only have 30 cards with which to do so.</p>

<p>The double minion value helps bring aggro decks’ power in line with control because control decks tend to have a much higher per-card value. A good control or midrange deck has powerful minions like Dr. Boom or <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/sylvanaswindrunner.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Sylvanas Windrunner</span></span>
 that do more than a 3/1 with Charge.</p>

<p>Despite some players’ feelings, helping aggro decks is good for the meta and game. Aggro decks are cheaper to craft and let newbies compete with players who have the time or money to craft every legendary in their golden Control Warrior build.</p>

<p>Aggro helps teach tempo and value as well. Knowing when to trade and when to go face is essential to a high win rate with Zoo or Face Hunter. The best aggro players know how to make just enough trades to keep tempo and prevent their opponents from making favorable trades. Knowing that balance will make you a better Hearthstone player with every deck.</p>

<p>Future sticky minions may not be as ubiquitous as Haunted Creeper, but it’s good Blizzard is keeping them in the game.</p>
