From a [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKd6eLIFRs) by Kripp showing a game with the "craziest RNG swing ever":

> "You get a little bit lucky here, you get a little bit unlucky there. Overall, you kinda flatten out if you average it out. That's kinda how it works, that's kinda how it has to work."

This attitude of taking offense at bad luck is unfortunately common in the Hearthstone community. **Bad luck is no one's fault.**

Any game that begins with shuffling a deck of cards will always be random. Chance is an inherent part part of the game. 

You're also not entitled to good luck. When you use {% include card src="imp-losion.png" name="Imp-losion" end="true" %}, only one outcome deals four damage. The other two are equally valid and probable. 

You even see that in Kripp's video when he wins the RNG lottery and reincarnates {% include card src="kelthuzad.png" name="Kel'Thuzad" %} (10:57).
