[Zadinaa](http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/user/28899-zadina/), writing for [Icy Veins](http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/20121-hearthstone-new-mage-hero-khadgar-lore-controversy-and-issues/): 

> iPhone and iPad users noticed a new Hearthstone update, which will bring yet another Mage hero to the game: Khadgar! Khadgar is significantly cheaper ($4.99 / € 4.99 / £3.99) than the other purchasable hero skins and all the proceed will go to World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The offer stands until April 24 and is only available to iOS users.

Careful before buying. As noted on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4er8jl/khadgar_is_being_added_to_ios/), you can't log in on PC or Mac after buying Khadgar.
