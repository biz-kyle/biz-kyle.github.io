From a [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpKd6eLIFRs) by Kripp showing a game with the "craziest RNG swing ever":

> "You get a little bit lucky here, you get a little bit unlucky there. Overall, you kinda flatten out if you average it out. That's kinda how it works, that's kinda how it has to work."

Kripp seems to take his luck in stride, but many don't. There's an unfortunately common attitude in the Hearthstone community of taking offense to bad luck. **Bad luck is no one's fault.**

Any game that begins with shuffling a deck of cards will always be random. Chance is an inherent part part of the game. 

You're also not entitled to good luck. When you use {% include card src="imp-losion.png" name="Imp-losion" end="true" %}, only one outcome deals four damage. The other two are equally valid and probable. Not every game can be a highlight-worthy stream of luck. 

Like Kripp said, you win some and lose some in a game with so much randomness. Accepting that is necessary for enjoying Hearthstone. See Kripp after reincarnating {% include card src="kelthuzad.png" name="Kel'Thuzad" %} (10:57).
