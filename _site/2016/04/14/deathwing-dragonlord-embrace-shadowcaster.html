    <p>For anyone who thought Blizzard would give us only bad cards, here are two that could be playable.</p>

<p><span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/deathwingdragonlord.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Deathwing, Dragonlord</span></span>
 is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgKusQzgpH8">Kibler’s reveal</a>.</p>

<iframe width="560" style="max-width: 100%;" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xgKusQzgpH8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>From the video:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frankly, this is exactly the kind of ability a big 10-mana minion ought to have. Even if your opponent kills it, you feel like you’ve gotten super paid off because you’ve gotten this huge effect of dumping all of your dragons in play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kibler points out that this is a huge threat that still delivers after being hit by <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/oldbiggamehunter.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Big Game Hunter</span></span>,
 making it earn more of the 10-mana cost.</p>

<p>I’m skeptical on this one. Dragon decks have never lacked high-cost threats. 10 mana on one card without Taunt seems too large a tempo loss. Besides, how many dragons will you have in your hand at turn 10 or 11? The whole point of dragon decks is keeping tempo and playing powerful minions on curve.</p>

<p>I also wouldn’t want to lose every dragon in my hand and be unable to activate <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/blackwingcorruptor.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Blackwing Corruptor</span></span>
 or <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/twilightguardian.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Twilight Guardian</span></span>,
 the latter of which would also be pulled from your hand without activating its battlecry.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if your opponent cannot rush past Deathwing and burst you down, this seems almost impossible to deal with.</p>

<h2 id="shadowpriest-viable">Shadowpriest viable?</h2>

<p><span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/embracetheshadow.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Embrace the Shadow</span></span>
 received little love from the community on release. In theory, <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/auchenaisoulpriest.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Auchenai Soulpriest</span></span>
 is better because its effect lasts more than one turn and provides a body on the board. In practice, I’ve found it suffers the same problem as <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/oldknifejuggler.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Knife Juggler</span></span>
 in that it’s so good your opponent will almost always kill it the next turn.</p>

<p>This puts Embrace the Shadow, which lets you use <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/circleofhealing.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Circle of Healing</span></span>
 one turn sooner, ahead of Auchenai. If nothing else, it’ll allow some crazy combo decks with <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/flashheal.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Flash Heal</span></span>.</p>

<h2 id="rogue-nerf-incoming">Rogue nerf incoming?</h2>

<p><span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/shadowcaster.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Shadowcaster</span></span>
 is a rare powerful Rogue card. My first thought seeing this is of course grabbing a 1/1 copy of my <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/ysera.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Ysera</span></span>.
 Can’t wait to see how people use this card in combo decks.</p>

<p>Shadowcaster also tells us some about where the game is going. Cards like it and <span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/heraldvolazj.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Herald Volazj</span></span>
 that make 1/1 copies are cards you run to duplicate the effects on the targeted cards. These effects, of course, are vulnerable to Silence. Consider this more proof <a href="/2016/04/09/silence-rebalance-counter-hearthstone-standard.html">Blizzard is nerfing Silence</a>.</p>

<p>It’s also a powerful Rogue card, something Blizzard has been very careful not to print because the basic Rogue cards are so strong. Rogues, consider this another sign <a href="/2016/04/09/silence-rebalance-counter-hearthstone-standard.html">your class will be nerfed</a>.</p>

<h2 id="other-cards">Other cards</h2>

<ul>
  <li><span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/facelesssummoner.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Faceless Summoner</span></span>
 - Phenomenal card that doesn’t fit any known Mage decks.</li>
  <li><span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/servantofyogg-saron.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Servant of Yogg-Saron</span></span>
 - Too inconsistent for constructed.</li>
  <li><span class="card"><img class="cardimg" src="/blog/assets/cards/forlornstalker.png" lazyload="" /><span class="cardtext">Forlorn Stalker</span></span>
 - Looks fantastic for my Midrange Hunter deck.</li>
