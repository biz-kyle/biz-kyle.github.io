When Blizzard [announced the Standard nerfs]({% post_url 2016-04-20-nerf-standard-druid-combo-knife-juggler %}), I was surprised to see Freeze Mage had somehow escaped Blizzard's wrath. They targeted cards that were used in too many decks ({% include card name="Knife Juggler" src="oldknifejuggler.png" end=")" %} and cards that encouraged uninteractive, unfun burst damage combos ({% include card name="Arcane Golem" src="oldarcanegolem.png" end=")." %}

Under that logic, you'd expect them to target a deck build off of uninteractive combos. The whole point of Freeze Mage is to hold your opponent at bay before you burst him down with an uninteractive combo of {% include card name="Alexstrasza" %} and spell damage. 

That's the thing, though. Freeze Mage was nerfed. Blizzard was just subtle about it. 

## Cards going away

The most obvious change to the deck is the loss of {% include card name="Mad Scientist" end="." %} That card is always a fantastic draw because it could keep tempo in the early game and pull one of your secrets, all of which are critical to winning. 

The ability to pull an {% include card name="Ice Block" %} from your deck shouldn't be underestimated either. That card is a critical part of your win condition, and skipping the three-mana cost to play it is pretty great. **Strike one.** 

## Aggro everywhere

A deck's quality is always relative to everything else in the meta. Greedy control decks suffer when aggro is in the driver's seat, just like aggro took a backseat to control and midrange with the introduction of {% include card name="Reno Jackson" end="." %}

Blizzard knocked Freeze Mage down a peg by taking away Mad Scientist, but it helped create an unfavorable meta for the deck. They left Aggro Shaman with almost all its tools, even giving an incredibly powerful new one with {% include card name="Flamewreathed Faceless" end="." %}

Aggro decks, especially ones that rely on weapon and spell damage, are tough for Freeze Mage to block. Simply put, you can't {% include card name="Flamestrike" %} his {% include name="Doomhammer" end="." %}

Besides, the board clears are often too late. Without Mad Scientist to contest the board in the early game and pull an {% include card name="Ice Barrier" end="," %} the early game becomes a matter of drawing as many cards as possible and possibly using single-target removal like {% include card name="Forgotten Torch" end="." %} 

Waiting until turn 4 or 5 to {% include card name="Frost Nova" %} + {% include card name="Doomsayer" %} is death against a deck as fast as Aggro Shaman. Oh, and Aggro Shaman is all over the ladder **Strike two.**

## One more bad matchup

Freeze Mage is even worse off in the current meta because [N'Zoth Control](http://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/legendary-paladin-n-zoth-control-standard-deck) exists. A deck built around hard-to-clear deathrattles and copious amounts of healing? Freeze Mage's worst nightmare. 

{% include card name="Forbidden Healing" %} is what makes this matchup exponentially more competitive for Paladins. Before, Uther had {% include card name="Antique Healbot" %} and {% include card name="Lay on Hands" end="." %} Those were decent, but they cost a lot of mana relative to the amount of healing. 

Now that Paladins are running absurd amounts of healing, I would rate this matchup as almost as bad as against Control Warrior. Between N'Zoth and Forbidden Healing, Blizzard created another good meta deck that Freeze Mage struggles against. **Strike three.**

## It's still decent

Freeze Mage in the current meta is an interesting example of how power level actually works in Hearthstone. Despite ostensibly losing few cards, Freeze Mage ended up as a second-tier deck in today's meta because of the growth of aggro and gaining another bad matchup. An elegant rebalancing.
