Blizzard, in a post to their forums caught by [Icy Veins](http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/21157-facebook-will-be-integrated-into-battlenet/): 

> The companies announced today that a major step in their ongoing collaboration will begin later this month with the integration of Facebook Login in Blizzard’s PC games. This will enable players to sign up for and log in to games... using their Facebook accounts<br><br>Adding Facebook Login will pave the way for new social functionality in Blizzard games while highlighting Facebook’s capabilities as a platform for sharing, viewing, and discussing AAA game content. As an example, Blizzard is in the process of incorporating Facebook’s Live API in order to create its own “Go Live” streaming functionality for its games. When this functionality is implemented, players will for the first time be able to livestream their Blizzard-gaming sessions directly to their Facebook timelines, and friends will be able to subscribe and be notified when new streams are available.

Interesting. Facebook has never showed much interest in catering to gamers.
