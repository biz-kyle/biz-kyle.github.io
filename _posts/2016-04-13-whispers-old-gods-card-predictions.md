Shevvek, writing for [Esports Hero](https://blog.esportshero.com/getting-card-reviews-right-part-two-beyond-curve/) about why we overlook certain new cards: 

> It should go without saying, but a card only needs to be good in one deck to be good. Too many card reviewers underrate cards for not fitting in the majority of decks. As long as a card is excellent in one good deck, who cares if it fits in anything else?

Considering no one predicted [classic Grim Patron Warrior](http://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/season-19-legendary-grim-patron-warrior-brm-deck), the strongest deck to ever exist in Hearthstone, take pre-release predictions with a massive grain of salt. 

Checking stats against a common baseline is easy. Guessing the relative strength of untested synergies in a future meta? Almost impossible.
