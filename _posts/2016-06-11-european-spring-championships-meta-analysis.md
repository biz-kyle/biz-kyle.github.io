A few things about this [HearthPwn](http://www.hearthpwn.com/news/1479-european-spring-championships-decklists-and-meta) list stand out to me. 

* Hunter is in better shape than most people think, especially with {% include card name="Call of the Wild" end="." %}
* Freeze Mage is still oddly popular, despite being [elegantly nerfed in Standard]({% post_url 2016-05-14-freeze-mage-hidden-nerfs %}). It hasn't done well in the spring preliminaries I saw, but that's not stopping anyone. 
* Warrior still has a shocking amount of diversity. The class known for being all control all the time now has *four* viable archetypes. Incredible.
