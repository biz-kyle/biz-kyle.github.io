Blizzard community manager Keganbe [on the forums](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/20743020458#1): 

> After careful consideration, we have decided to make a change to the rank displayed on your friends list once Standard and Wild formats go live.<br><br>Previously, we announced that your current rank in Standard would be the rank displayed next to your name on your friends list. Instead, once the Year of the Kraken officially begins, your best current rank--whether Standard or Wild--will automatically be displayed on your friends list.

Elegant way to assuage players' fear of Standard, the real issue.
