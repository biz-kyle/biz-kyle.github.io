Some exciting legendaries coming up. 

* {% include card name="Shifter Zerus" %} \- Can't believe Blizzard made a better {% include card name="Unstable Portal" end="." %} Knowing what you get more than makes up for no mana discount. 
* {% include card name="Princess Huhuran" %} \- Extremely powerful in a Midrange Hunter. Using this with even a {% include card name="Webspinner" %} would be strong. 
* [Dark Arakkoa](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/4f6p9b/whispers_of_the_old_gods_reveals_for_04172016/)

>  6-mana common Druid minion, 5/7, Taunt, Battlecry: Give your C'thun +3/+3

Good stats, good effect. 

* [Demented Frostcaller](https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/4ewk5o/whispers_of_the_old_gods_reveals_for_04152016/)

> 4-mana rare Mage minion, 2/4, After you cast a spell, freeze a random enemy. 

Curious to see if this makes it into Tempo Mage decks. 

* {% include card name="Shifting Shade" %} \- I'd pull one from {% include card name="Museum Curator" end="." %}
