Hearthstone pro [Leadpaint](http://pro.eslgaming.com/hearthstone/legendary/winter-2014-15/player/leadpaint/) on his choice of decks to [LiquidHearth](http://www.liquidhearth.com/forum/hearthstone/507590-leadpaint-zoo-is-the-best-deck-in-the-game): 

> We brought the right decks and we brought the right lists. Lots of people bring sub-optimal lists. Everyone in my group brought card for card the same lineup and made at least top 16. If these are the best decks we're going to bring them regardless of stigma.

This is how you win. Never think of decks as "[cancer](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/search?q=cancer&restrict_sr=on)" or "low skill." That's [scrub thinking](http://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win).
