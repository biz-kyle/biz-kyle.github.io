> Looking at all the numbers, you can make out a ranking, which mana is the most effective to play Forbidden Shaping on. It is clearly the 8-Mana spot. There are simply good minions and no bad ones in this cost category. 

Great [infographic](http://8gmwp015fo-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/05/Forbidden-Shaping-1.22.jpg) from [BlizzPro](http://hearthstone.blizzpro.com/2016/05/25/forbidden-shaping-infographic-standard-kraken/). Interesting that it's better not to play {% include card name="Forbidden Shaping" %} with 10 mana.
