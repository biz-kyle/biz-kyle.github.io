[Richard Procter](https://twitter.com/rhprocter?lang=en), writing for [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/features/2016/4/13/11416002/attempting-to-master-hearthstone-in-30-days): 

> eople have always yearned to quit their jobs and make a living at one of their hobbies. And with the advent of both esports and streaming services like Twitch and Youtube Gaming, making a living playing video games has become more feasible than ever before. I liked Hearthstone and always felt at home playing competitive card games. So I thought, what if I (mostly) quit my day job and played Hearthstone for 6+ hours a day?<br><br>As one might expect, a large gap separates "more feasible" and "easy."

Takes more than 30 days to become that good. Procter also got advice from professional streamers on being a pro gamer:

> "Don’t do it," (Reynad) said. "There’s so few players that can actually get by by winning tournaments. Because no matter what, to win a tournament, no matter how good you are, you have to be lucky and good. You have to not only be lucky to win a tournament, but you have to be lucky and win the big tournaments with the big paychecks. Without doing that, it’s not consistent, sustainable revenue."
