Silence will likely see significant changes in Standard. Monk, writing in [LiquidHearth](http://www.liquidhearth.com/forum/hearthstone/506312-monk-visits-blizzard-changes-coming-to-standard): 

> Blizzard is looking to weaken Silence overall. According to developers, it felt strange when you played a buff deck and it just happens to get countered because you happen to have two Silences innately built into your Druid deck. Extrapolating this could point to cards like Ironbeak Owl and Spellbreaker receiving nerfs.

If we accept Blizzard will change cards based on whether they [limit potential future designs]({% post_url 2016-04-08-hearthstone-standard-nerfs %}), an overall Silence nerf makes sense. Only gimmick decks rely heavily on buffs because everyone plays at least one {% include card src="ironbeakowl.gif" name="Ironbeak Owl" %}\. 

Brian Kibler presented a [potential alternative](http://www.pcgamer.com/brian-kibler-on-why-silence-is-not-golden-in-hearthstone/) for *PC Gamer* back in October:

> It is important for players to feel like they have the ability to interfere with what their opponents are trying to do outside of having to outright kill every minion that gets played. [...] <br><br>Right now, lots of decks play Silence effects, but for wildly different reasons. Iâ€™d like to see cards that directly address individual abilities, so that players who are specifically looking to deal with those categories of cards have more options.

More granular counters and room for buff decks? Seems like a no-brainer.
