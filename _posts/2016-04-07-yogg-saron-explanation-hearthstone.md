Powerful name, powerful randomness. 

<!--break-->

> **Battlecry**: Cast a random spell for each spell you've cast this game (targets chosen randomly).

From a nicely detailed explanation on [/r/hearthstone](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4dsca4/a_summary_of_yoggsarons_extra_details_on_how_it/): 

* The spells can target any character, including your own hero and your opponent's hero ([source](https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/718123862127427584))
* If a randomly selected spell has no eligible target, it will "fizzle" ([source](https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/718126188678479872))
* Spells won't trigger Mana Wyrm, Mana Addict, Antonidas, Flamewaker, Gallywix or Lorewalker Cho ([source](https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/718132869109981184))
* Spells that require discarding will cause discards ([source](https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/718146133558734849))
* Brann will make Yogg-Saron perform its battlecry twice for double the chaos ([source](https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/718130744330207232))

Too random to be competitive, but amazing potential for YouTube highlight videos.
