Great catch by [HearthPwn](http://www.hearthpwn.com/news/1481-game-mode-id-coming-to-hearthstone-new-in-game):

> Game Mode ID shows an icon beside your name, much like the rank emblems you see on the ladder today, but are specific to each game mode. Arena, Tavern Brawl, Adventures, and Casual will all be getting unique icons, and some will have extra functionality.

> * Arena icon displays your current win count and below it, you can see how many losses you have on the current run.

> * Tavern Brawl icon lets you mouseover it to view the rules of the current brawl.

> * Adventure icon uses an icon from the adventure. No functionality was described.

> * Casual icons look pretty.

Would love to see my opponent's win streak in Arena.
