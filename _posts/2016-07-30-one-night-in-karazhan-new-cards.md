> ou’re invited to attend the shindig of the millennium at Azeroth’s most terrific tower—Karazhan! As Medivh’s guest, you’ll experience everything his delightful domicile has to offer while rubbing shoulders with Azeroth’s most fascinating beings and dancing the night away in Hearthstone’s next Adventure: **One Night in Karazhan!**

Looks like a good time. The first mission of the adventure will be free, which means everyone will get {% include card name="Enchanted Raven" %} and {% include card name="Firelands Portal" %} free. 

## Analysis

Enchanted Raven looks incredibly powerful. A 2-2 1-drop, and a beast no less, means we'll see Token Beast Druid in force soon. Time for a {% include card name="Savage Roar" %} comeback? 

Some people online had a negative reaction to Firelands Portal. I feel more positive about the card. Seven mana is steep, but the ability to remove a minion while summoning a minion is extremely powerful. That kind of swingy gameplay is what made {% include card name="Imp-losion" %} so strong. 

{% include card name="Kindly Grandmother" %} is too slow and doesn't synergize with any known Hunter deck. 

{% include card name="Raving Grimoire" %} has potential in Tempo Mage, though it lacks the sheer value of {% include card name="Cabalist's Tome" src="cabaliststome.png" end="." %}

{% include card name="Ivory Knight" %} seems extremely strong. It's a tempo loss, but this would be incredible in a slower metagame. 

{% include card name="Ethereal Peddler" %} is a card I can't make heads or tails of. It's got great stats for its cost, so maybe play this and hope it might get value with your {% include card name="Undercity Huckster" end="?" %}

{% include card name="Imp of Malchezaar" %} has interesting combo potential. I'd guess it will suffer from the {% include card name="Knife Juggler" %} effect - your opponent will always immediately kill it, so you've got one turn tops to use it. 

{% include card name="Barnes" %} just seems bad. {% include card name="Y'Shaarj, Rage Unbound" src="yshaarjrageunbound.png" %} didn't work and this won't either. 

{% include card name="The Curator" %} has potential as a good build-around card. You don't need to fill your decks with Murlocs, Dragons and Beasts to get value- just one or two good ones of each kind. 

Reddit is keeping a [pre-release list](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4v60mk/the_marvelous_prerelease_reveal_chart_all/) of new announced cards, so keep an eye on it.
