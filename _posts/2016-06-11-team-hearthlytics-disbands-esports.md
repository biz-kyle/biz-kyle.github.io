As announced on [TwitLonger](http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1soof2o): 

> In the beginning we scouted and signed some of the most successful ladder and online players in the North American scene. Naturally, we assumed talent would bring in victories which would be followed by publicity and popularity. This worked, for a while. We soon hit our ceiling for sponsorships that we could actively work with and provide the results they need to sponsor us monetarily. We worked to increase salaries for the players by incentivizing work related tasks instead of just a monthly stipend (i.e. paying them for creating content, winning tournaments, and promoting the team/sponsors). Truthfully, this is where we went wrong. We created a scenario where professionals who were interested in being the best they can be at a craft were suddenly doing outside-game or uncompetitive related tasks too frequently for their liking.

Esports is growing, but making money is [not easy]({% post_url 2016-04-15-ladder-hearthstone-pro-30-days %}). 

It's especially difficult since in the Hearthstone community there's an expectation that content creators be pro players as well. Who has the time to do both?
