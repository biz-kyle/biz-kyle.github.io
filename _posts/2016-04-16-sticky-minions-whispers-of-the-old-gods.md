{% include card name="Haunted Creeper" %} is cycling out of standard, but sticky minions are not. 

A livestream by GameplayRJ [revealed](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/4ec779/new_card_revealed/) {% include card src="twilightsummoner.png" name="Twilight Summoner" end="," %} an interesting neutral epic. 

> 4-mana, 1/1
> Deathrattle: Summon a 5/5 Faceless Destroyer

Twilight Summoner, {% include card src="possessedvillager.png" name="Possessed Villager" end="," %} and {% include card src="infestedtauren.png" name="Infested Tauren" %} show Blizzard sees "sticky" minions (minions that summon other minions as their deathrattle) as a good addition to the game. 

While not as strong as previous deathrattle powerhouses Haunted Creeper and {% include card name="Piloted Shredder" end="," %} these new minions still survive a board clear. This makes them annoying to control decks but important to the game's health overall. 

A Hearthstone meta with no sticky minions is one where Freeze Mage and other board clear-heavy decks dominate competitive play. Sticky minions empower zoo decks by providing minions and tempo which can't be immediately wiped away.

Hearthstone has so few ways to interact with your opponents' spells, especially for aggro decks since {% include card name="Loatheb" %} is cycling out. Minions that spawn other minions are one of your few ways to fight back against {% include card name="Flamestrike" end="." %}[^1]

[^1]: I see this concept in action whenever I play [Zoo](http://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/warlock-zoo-loe-deck) vs. [Freeze Mage](http://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/legendary-mage-freeze-loe-deck), a matchup where me beating the mage relies almost entirely on good sticky minions like Creeper and Piloted Shredder. 

## We need aggro

Sticky minions also provide unique value to aggro decks. Cards like Haunted Creeper and Infested Tauren provide two minions inside one card, an invaluable proposition when your plan is to flood the board with minions and you only have 30 cards with which to do so. 

The double minion value helps bring aggro decks' power in line with control because control decks tend to have a much higher per-card value. A good control or midrange deck has powerful minions like Dr. Boom or {% include card name="Sylvanas Windrunner" %} that do more than a 3/1 with Charge. 

Despite some players' feelings, helping aggro decks is good for the meta and game. Aggro decks are cheaper to craft and let newbies compete with players who have the time or money to craft every legendary in their golden Control Warrior build. 

Aggro helps teach tempo and value as well. Knowing when to trade and when to go face is essential to a high win rate with Zoo or Face Hunter. The best aggro players know how to make just enough trades to keep tempo and prevent their opponents from making favorable trades. Knowing that balance will make you a better Hearthstone player with every deck. 

Future sticky minions may not be as ubiquitous as Haunted Creeper, but it's good Blizzard is keeping them in the game.
