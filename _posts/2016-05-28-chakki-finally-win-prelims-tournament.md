Chakki, speaking to [LiquidHearth](http://www.liquidhearth.com/forum/hearthstone/509529-chakki-on-finally-getting-his-win) on earning a much-deserved tournament victory: 

> When Hearthstone gets a new metagame people are generally pretty all over the place with their decks. Decks are really unrefined: aggro decks aren't as aggressive as they can be and control decks aren't as greedy as they can be. The two best ways to exploit that are to run all aggro or all greedy control. My playing group didn't think aggro was strong enough right now so we made some very greedy control decks to try to win control mirrors. It was a metagame read that could have failed but it was definitely a solid read for the tournament.
