Blizzard president Mike Morhaime, speaking to [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/17/11692694/blizzard-twitch-harassment-racism-dreamhack-hearthstone):

> "We're extremely disappointed by the hateful, offensive language used by some of the online viewers during the DreamHack Austin event the weekend before last," Morhaime said. "One of our company values is 'Play Nice; Play Fair;' we feel there's no place for racism, sexism, harassment, or other discriminatory behavior, in or outside of the gaming community."

What happened to TerrenceM was unacceptable. Glad Blizzard is working to fix this.
