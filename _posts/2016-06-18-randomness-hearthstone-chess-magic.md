Randomness is too misunderstood for being so integral to Hearthstone. I constantly see people complain that "RNG" (random number generator) made them lose. Ask any casual Hearthstone fan what the biggest problem with the game is and they will likely cite its randomness. 

This opinion is just one thing that makes casual fans casual. Any serious player should understand randomness is not only critical to collectible card games, it actually makes them better. 

## Chess and win rates

To understand why chance makes Hearthstone more fun, let's look at a game almost devoid of chance, chess. Aside from picking white or black, there is [no real randomness](http://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/4447/randomness-in-chess) to chess. Each player gets one move during their turn to move a piece that behaves the same way every time. Both players start with the same pieces on a uniform, symmetrical board. 

Chess is a demanding game to play well. To become an expert requires thousands of hours learning tactics and strategies. You win or lose based on your skill, no dice rolling involved. If [this thread](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/winning-percentage-goals-of-chess-players) of chess players is anything to go by, win rate is basically a function of how often you play someone better than you. 

Hearthstone (and other CCGs like Magic: The Gathering) are not like that. There is so much randomness built into Blizzard's game that the percentage of a worse player beating a better one is much, much higher. 

The worst beginner can queue up against a pro player and still have a chance to win greater than in a more pure skill game like chess. For humorous proof, see this video of [Forsen losing to a rank 25 player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJjN9CGnDzo) or this fantastic replay of [Amaz losing to a rank 25 Mage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMpymIVBxMc) rocking {% include card name="Arcane Explosion" end="." %}

Win rates of skill-intensive games like chess almost completely reflect the skill disparities of the two players. When a better player faces off against a worse one, the outcome is pre
